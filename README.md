### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an Electrical Engineering student at UFES. I'm enthusiastic about robotics, IoT, Data Science, and Machine Learning. 

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently a research student at UFES' Human Centered System Lab, where I'm exploring cloud-based VR. I use tools like Unity, C#, and Python in this project. 
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently exploring Data Science and Machine Learning. I'm fascinated by how these areas can positively impact various aspects of our daily lives, making things more efficient.
- âš¡ I have a keen creative side and love hands-on activities. Painting, drawing, nail art, and recently, I've been really into crafting with cold porcelain. In my downtime, you'll usually find me gaming â€“ Stardew Valley is my all-time favorite â€“ or binge-watching sitcoms, my go-to genre.
